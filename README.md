PE #67: https://youtu.be/JG2Tv_raIz4

In this video we see how to discretize a continuous system. The RC filter is taken as an example. Qspice simulations are shown to illustrate the different ideas. In the second part we will see how to discretize the transfer function of a dc-dc converter.

In this second part we see how to discretize the transfer function of a current-mode dc-dc buck converter. Qspice simulations are shown to verify the correctness of the discretization process.
